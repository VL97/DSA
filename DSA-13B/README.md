Data Structures and Algorithms at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus
--------------
* This repo hosts my attempts on selected problems as a part of Data Structures and Algorithms course at BITS Pilani. 
* All solutions are in C. 

Code: 
* Most solutions are commented and self explanatory. 
* CamelCase has been used consistently throughout all codes authored by me. Codes used from web sources have been attributed wherever possible.
