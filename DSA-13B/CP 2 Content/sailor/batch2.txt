Consider two lists, one list containing SAIL_MAX sailors and another list 
  containing BOAT_MAX  boats. Each sailor contains the following information
 in its record (as given in file boatsail.h) 

1. An unsigned int sid representing the unique identification number
                        of the Sailor.
2. A character array of maximum 30 characters for the name of Sailor.
3. An unsigned int exp for indicating the experience of a Sailor. 
4. An unsigned int ownsbid that represents the unique id of boat owned
                        by the Sailor.

  Each boat contains the following information in its record (as given
  in file boatsail.h).

1. An unsigned int bid representing the unique identification number
                        of the Boat.
2. A character array of maximum 30 characters for the name of Boat.
3. An unsigned int numSailed for storing the number of ours the Boat
                        has sailed in sea.

The operations supported by these data types are given in boatsailOps.h

1. int locateBoat(ID boatid, BoatList bl, Size s);
       searches for a Boat with id as boatid in the unordered list 
       BoatList bl. It returns the position at which such a boat is found
       in BoatList bl. If no such Boat is found, whose id is boatid, the
       function returns -666.

2. void PrintDetails(SailorList sl, Size sailors, BoatList bl, Size boats);
	Prints the details of all sailors in the SailorList sl.
	The function prints the name of the sailor, his id, the name of
	the boat he owns and its number of hours sailed.
	Assume sailors and boats are greater than 0.

3. void sortSailors(SailorList sl, Size sailors, BoatList bl, Size boats);

	Sorts the sailors in the SailorList , sl, based on non-decreasing
	order of the number of hours the boats owned by them have sailed.
	If more than one sailor owns boats that have traelled the same
	duration, then sort them based on increasing order of the sailor's
	id. Implement sorting with the help of insertion sort. The
        sortSailors function uses the function insertSailor as described
	below.

4. void insertSailor(Sailor s, SailorList sl, Size sailors,
                  BoatList bl, Size boats)
 
	Inserts the Sailor s into the SailorList sl, maintaining the order
	as descrbed above.

Complete the above mentioned functions in boatsailOps.c.
Assume that all precondition are checked before making function calls.
 (You need not check the precondition in your code).

Compilation:

gcc -c boatsailOps.c
gcc -o exe main.c boatsailOps.o
