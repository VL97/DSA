the author of these travels mr lemuel gulliver is my ancient and intimate friend there is likewise some relation between us on the motherâ€™s side about three years ago mr gulliver growing weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in redriff made a small purchase of land with a convenient house near newark in nottinghamshire his native country where he now lives retired yet in good esteem among his neighbours although mr gulliver was born in nottinghamshire where his father dwelt yet I have heard him say his family came from oxfordshire to confirm which I have observed in the churchyard at banbury in that county several tombs and monuments of the gullivers before he quitted redriff he left the custody of the following papers in my hands with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit I have carefully perused them three times the style is very plain and simple and the only fault I find is that the author after the manner of travellers is a little too circumstantial there is an air of truth apparent through the whole and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours at redriff when any one affirmed a thing to say it was as true as if mr gulliver had spoken it by the advice of several worthy persons to whom with the author permission I communicated these papers I now venture to send them into the world hoping they may be at least for some time a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common scribbles of politics and party this volume would have been at least twice as large if I had not made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides as well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages together with the minute descriptions of the management of the ship in storms in the style of sailors likewise the account of longitudes and latitudes wherein I have reason to apprehend that mr gulliver may be a little dissatisfied but I was resolved to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of readers however if my own ignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes I alone am answerable for them and if any traveller hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large as it came from the hands of the author I will be ready to gratify him as for any further particulars relating to the author the reader will receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book
